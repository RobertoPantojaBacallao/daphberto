      "paragraph": "This picture always takes me back to those first few months with you. It reminds me of when I'd spend hours combing through google for the perfect dates and how nervous I'd be to ask you on them. What really surprised me about you was how relaxed and content you always seemed. From the moment I picked you up to when I dropped you off your focus was on us. You made me feel like you were happy just going on a drive together. That time spent just being in each other's presence made me feel loved and cared for. I still love going on a walk/drive together and just enjoying each others company. You make mundane moments feel sublime."

      "paragraph": "BOO!\n\nWe've spent countless hours together in many different spots all around the world and exponentially more hours together hanging out at home. The best times I've had with you ave been here. There's something so relaxing and fun about cuddling together in bed in silence, talking about our day, or fighting over control of the other's nipples. I love the times you show me all the stupid reels you've been saving for me and I love the times when we're both so tired we fall asleep in our arms. As much I love exploring new places, this time spent together means the most to me."

      "paragraph": "This was the first time we'd be spending an extended period of time together. I was so worried we would butt heads or get angry at each other, but we had the most amazing time. I was so surprised by how comfortable you were exploring the more remote areas. When we had to hike an hour across a river and over a mountain through the mud you stood there unphased. Somehow you did all of that without complaining once, but when we'd walk around San Juan for more than 10 minutes you'd lose your mind. We had such a good time looking around the city, trying different spots and feeding dirty pigeons.\n\nThis trip made me realize I could spend every day with you."

      "paragraph": "The word \"FaceTime\" has a negative connotation for me. It serves as a reminder that you're a thousand miles away (ðŸ‘Ž) and it's going to be weeks until I see you again (ðŸ‘Ž). \n\nThat being said, whenever we do facetime I'm reminded of how much I love being with you. I get to see all of the little mannerisms and facial expressions that I miss so much. I always forget how much I love your smile until we hop on a facetime call and I say something stupid. They make me miss you more, but they keep me sane."

      "paragraph": "You know when I first came to New York I thought you'd be excited to come visit me and explore a new city, but it turns out you didn't care lol. It took me a while to get used to that, I'd always ask you what you wanted to see or do in the city, but you made it clear that you were here for me and nothing else. \n\nNothing except the Met of course. I loved watching you go nonverbal and wander off to go look at whatever painting caught your eye."

      "paragraph": "I kicked off this trip by sitting at the Oslo airport for half an hour trying to spot anyone that looked liked you as if I hadn't seen you in years. It had been two (2) weeks.\n\nSpending two weeks by your side doing nothing but walking, eating, and going to museums was the best thing I could have asked for. It was peak old married couple behavior. We were halfway across the world exploring beautiful cities but going to sleep at 9pm or going home early to watch another episode of fleabag.\n\nEven though we were in foreign countries, I felt at home everywhere I went with you."

I can vividly recall all the times Thaylin texted me months in advance trying to plan the perfect birthday for you. And it all fell apart smh.\n\nA day spent exploring museums and getting mediterranean food turned into a night at a park drawing pictures. I could tell you were happy to be around Thaylin and Michelle to cleberate your birthday and it really made me appreciate the friendship you have with them. There's a lot of mutual love between the three of you and you felt comfortable enough to share some of that with me."
