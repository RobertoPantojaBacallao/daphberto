This picture always takes me back to those first few months with you.
It reminds me of when I'd spend hours combing through google for the perfect dates and how nervous I'd be to ask you on them.
What really surprised me about you was how relaxed and content you always seemed. From the moment I picked you up to when I dropped you off your focus was on us.
You made me feel like you were happy just going on a drive together. You never felt the need to fill the silence. That time spent just being in each other's presence made me feel loved and cared for.
